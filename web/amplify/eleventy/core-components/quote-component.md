Considerations
--------------

The W3C specification says that a reference to a creative work, as included within a `cite` element, may include the name of the work's author. However, the WHATWG specification for `cite` says the opposite: that a person's name must never be included, under any circumstances. Hence, the example above does not use `cite`.

To include a reference to the source of quoted material which is contained within a `blockquote` or `q` element, use the `cite` attribute on the element to provide a URL.
