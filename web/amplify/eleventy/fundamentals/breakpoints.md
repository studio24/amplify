Sass variables corresponding to generic device viewport widths, which are used within media query mixins. These values can be updated and new variables added as required for your project's needs.

The `$max-width` variable is used for limiting the maximum width of e.g. `main`.

The `$text-measure` variable is designed to be used to limit the maximum line length of text content for improved readability.
