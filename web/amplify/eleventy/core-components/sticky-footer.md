Amplify includes styles for a sticky footer, which you can see in action on this website wherever the page content is not long enough to push the footer beyond the bottom of the browser window.

There are [many ways to achieve a sticky footer](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/), but the approach favoured in Amplify is to [use CSS grid layout](https://css-tricks.com/couple-takes-sticky-footer/#aa-there-is-grid).
