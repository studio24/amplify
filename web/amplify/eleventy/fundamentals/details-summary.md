title: Details and summary
---
The `details` element generates a simple no-JavaScript widget to show/hide content, optionally by selecting its child `summary` element. In non-supporting browsers such as IE11 all content is expanded by default.

This is the summary content

Considerations
--------------

There is currently no way for `details` to be made to display all of its content by default when printed.
