    #Cluster layout helper

    From https://absolutely.every-layout.dev/layouts/cluster/

    `.l-cluster` suits any groups of elements that differ in length and
    are liable to wrap. Use the Cluster to align any groups of horizontally
    laid out elements to the left or right, or in the center, with even
    spacing between elements.

/**
Suppress horizontal scrolling caused by the negative margin
in some circumstances.
 */
.l-cluster {
	overflow: hidden;
}


/**
We use flexbox to configure the elements into clusters without creating
white space. We can control how we align items within the cluster,
by using 'align-items` and `justify-content`.
 */
.l-cluster > * {
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: row;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
	margin: rem(-10);
}


/**
We apply an even, symmetrical margin to the elements that we wish to space
out, but halve it to to account for 'doubling up' at the edges.
