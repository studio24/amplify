		<h1>Kitchen sink</h1>
		<p>This is a test page filled with common HTML elements to be used to provide visual feedback whilst building CSS systems and frameworks.</p>
		<p>This paragraph contains a selection of HTML5 elements, such as <em>emphasis</em>, <strong>strong</strong>, and <small>small</small>. Some of these are explained in a bit more detail in the section about <a href="#phrasing-content">phrasing content</a>. See how <code>mark</code> is the HTML equivalent of the <mark>yellow highlighter</mark>. You can also use <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which sometimes is styled similarly to the <code>code</code> or <samp>samp</samp> elements. Even more specifically, there is an element just for <var>variables</var>. And let's not forget the sub (H<sub>2</sub>O) and sup (E = MC<sup>2</sup>) elements.</p>
