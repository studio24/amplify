title: Cover

The cover layout helper creates a container with a minimum height to hold vertically centered content, ideal for "above the fold" hero blocks and sections needing visual prominence. It uses the classes `l-cover` for the container and `principal` for the content to be centered.

"Header" content, e.g. a close button

The principal content

"Footer" content

### Considerations

By adding a class to "Header" and/or "Footer" we could then use `align-self: flex-end;` to shift them to the far edge of cover.
