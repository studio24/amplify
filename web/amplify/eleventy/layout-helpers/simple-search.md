title: Simple search form

Considerations
--------------

Note the use of `input type="search"`. It is recommended to include `role="search"` on the parent `form` element. [More about forms](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/fundamentals/forms.html).

Note the use of the [box layout](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/layout-helpers/box.html) and [sidebar layout](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/layout-helpers/sidebar.html) in this example.
