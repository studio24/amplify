Covering the essential aspects of any website project, such as colours, typography, button and links, lists, spacing and print styles.

Fundamentals are the underlining design principles and materials. A set of design choices, instructions and calculations to govern a project.

Test your fundamentals
----------------------

A good first milestone is to complete your fundamental settings and review them on the [typography test page](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/design/typography-test.html) with the designer.
