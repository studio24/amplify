Examples of commonly required components, the building blocks of web pages.

The [core components](https://github.com/studio24/amplify/blob/main/docs/css.md#css-architecture) directory handles the minimum required styles for all components, including the initial styles for more advanced components when JavaScript is not available. They are compiled into `core.css`, which is served to all browsers (along with `print.css`).
