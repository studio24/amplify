title: Text component
---
The most commonly-used component for adding content to a page. Use for prose, [lists](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/styles/lists.html) and [tables](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/styles/tables.html). For quotations, use the [quote component](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/core-components/quote.html).

Example text component
----------------------

Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book.

Considerations
--------------

To help maintain the page heading hierarchy, `h1` is not made available within the text component as this has its own specific location within the page template.

If you have prose split across multiple text components, with other components interspersed (e.g. the [image component](https://amplify.studio24.net/amplify/core-components/image-component.html)), be sure to check that no heading levels are accidentally skipped in the text components.
