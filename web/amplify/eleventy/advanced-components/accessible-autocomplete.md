title: Accessible auto-complete
---
A `select` can be enhanced into an accessible auto-complete via JavaScript. Amplify uses the [Accessible autocomplete](https://github.com/alphagov/accessible-autocomplete) NPM package, and there are a number of [example customisations](https://alphagov.github.io/accessible-autocomplete/examples/) which can be followed.

Follow the default markup for a `select`, making sure to give it a unique ID which can be referenced in the JavaScript.
