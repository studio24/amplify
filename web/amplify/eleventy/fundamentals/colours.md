Colour contrast
---------------

Make sure that the contrast ratio of text and interactive elements on your site meets the requirements of **WCAG 2.1** as paraphrased in the following sections. The ideal contrast range to meet all requirements is 7:1 - 15:1. Higher contrast ratios can be triggering for some people.

### 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)

Text (including images of text) has a contrast ratio of at least **4.5:1 for 'regular' text** and at least **3:1 for large text** (at least `18pt` / `24px`, or bold and at least `14pt` / `18.5px`), unless the text is purely decorative.

### 1.4.6 Contrast (Enhanced) (AAA)

Text (including images of text) has a contrast ratio of at least **7:1 for 'regular' text** and at least **4.5:1 for large text** (at least `18pt` / `24px`, or bold and at least `14pt` / `18.5px`), unless the text is purely decorative.

### 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast (AA)

The visual presentation of UI components (their states - including focus indication - and boundaries) and graphical objects has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colour(s).
